2.2 Sale of SensorLogic Services. SensorLogic Services are sold on an annual or other specified period (each, a “**Service Term**”). The initial Service Term starts when Customer purchases the SensorLogic Services. If Customer and SensorLogic have signed an order for SensorLogic Services, the Service Term will renew according to the terms of such order. If Customer has purchased the SensorLogic Services through a different method, the Service Term will automatically renew for successive periods of the same length as the initial Service Term.

2.3 Acceptance. SensorLogic reserves the right to accept or reject orders, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion, or to cancel any order previously accepted if SensorLogic determines that Customer is in default, Customer is in a location where SensorLogic cannot provide SensorLogic Products, or otherwise.

2.4 Fulfillment of Orders and Invoicing. SensorLogic will use commercially reasonable efforts to fill orders by Customer promptly upon acceptance by SensorLogic. SensorLogic retains the right to fulfill orders in part, based upon a SensorLogic-approved schedule. Any Customer requests for partial fulfillment are subject to approval by SensorLogic.

SensorLogic will select the carrier, unless the carrier chosen by SensorLogic will not fulfill the delivery, in which case Customer’s choice of substitute carrier is subject to SensorLogic approval. Customer will pay all freight, insurance, and other shipping expenses, as well as any special packing

**3. PAYMENTS**

3.1 Prices and Fees. The price of the SensorLogic Hardware and the fees for the SensorLogic Services are set forth on the signed order form or on the order confirmation page prior to finalizing the purchase. Customer agrees to pay SensorLogic the amounts indicated for the SensorLogic Hardware and SensorLogic Services Customer selects. The price of the SensorLogic Hardware will be charged to the Payment Method (defined below) upon checkout, and the cost of freight, insurance, and other shipping expenses, as well as any special packing expense, will be charged to the Payment Method upon shipment. The fees for the SensorLogic Services will be charged to the Payment Method upon checkout and will cover fees for the initial Service Term. If the Service Term renews, the fees for any renewal Service Terms will be the then-current fee applicable to the SensorLogic Services and will be charged to the payment method upon renewal, unless otherwise agreed in writing between Customer and SensorLogic. Customer authorizes SensorLogic to charge the Payment Method for the prices and fees described above. Customer may upgrade, downgrade or cancel the selected SensorLogic Service plan at any time. Plan downgrades or cancellations will take effect only at the end of the then-current Service Term and must be made at least 3 business days prior to the next renewal of the Service Term (if any) in order to avoid billing of the next renewal Service Term’s fees at the prior rate. Customer will not receive a refund or credit for the remainder of the Service Term in the event of any downgrade or cancellation during a Service Term. SensorLogic Service upgrades will take effect immediately and Customer will be charged a prorated fee for the remainder of the then-current term based on the difference in price between the current plan and the upgraded plan. Stated fees do not include any related taxes, duties and similar charges (including without limitation sales and use taxes, duties or other governmental taxes or fees), all of which are Customer’s responsibility and will be charged to Customer’s Payment Method in addition to the fees.

3.2 Payment Method. SensorLogic may, from time to time, offer various payment methods, including without limitation payment by wire transfer, ACH, credit card, by debit card, by certain mobile payment providers or by using PayPal. Customer authorizes SensorLogic to charge Customer for SensorLogic Products through the payment method selected by Customer when purchasing the SensorLogic Products (the “**Payment Method**”) and Customer agrees to make payment using such Payment Method(s). SensorLogic may, from time to time, receive and use updated payment method information provided by Customer or that financial institutions or payment processors may provide to SensorLogic to update information related to the Payment Method(s), such as updated expiration dates or account numbers. Certain Payment Methods, such as credit cards and debit cards, may involve agreements between Customer and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of the chosen Payment Methods (the “**Payment Method Provider**”). If SensorLogic does not receive payment from the Payment Method Provider, Customer agrees to directly pay all amounts due upon demand from SensorLogic. Customer’s non-termination or continued use of the SensorLogic Services reaffirms that SensorLogic is authorized to charge the Payment Method for each renewal Service Term.

3.3 Current Information Required. Customer agrees to provide current, complete and accurate billing information and agrees to promptly update all such information (such as changes in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date) as necessary for the processing of all payments that are due to SensorLogic. Customer agrees to promptly notify SensorLogic if the selected Payment Method is canceled (for example, due to loss or theft) or if Customer becomes aware of a potential breach of security related to any Payment Method. If Customer fails to provide any of the foregoing information, Customer acknowledges that its current Payment Method may continue to be charged for SensorLogic Products and it remains responsible for all such charges.

3.4 Payment Matters. If the Payment Method fails or Customer’s account is past due, SensorLogic reserves the right to withhold shipment of SensorLogic Hardware and to either suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the SensorLogic Services. Customer agrees to submit any disputes regarding any charge to its account in writing to SensorLogic within 60 days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. Customer agrees to reimburse SensorLogic for all collection costs. SensorLogic reserves the right to charge Customer interest at a rate of 1.5% per month on any overdue amounts, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is lower. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for shipped SensorLogic Hardware or any partially used Service Terms except (a) as expressly set forth in this Agreement or a separate written agreement between SensorLogic and Customer; (b) as otherwise required by applicable law; or (c) at SensorLogic’s sole and absolute discretion.

 \
6.4 Exceptions.

Customer is responsible for any costs or damages that result from these actions. \

If Customer is an entity incorporated or formed under the state or federal laws of the United States of America, the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”). If Customer is an entity incorporated or formed under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce (“**ICC**”) Rules of Arbitration. If there is a dispute between the parties under this Agreement, the parties will use good faith efforts to agree upon and appoint one arbitrator no later than 20 days after the notice of arbitration is received from the other party. If the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, the arbitrator will be selected in accordance with the applicable rules of the AAA or ICC (as applicable) for the appointment of an arbitrator. The selection of an arbitrator under the rules of the AAA or ICC will be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator must be independent of the parties. The arbitrator will conduct the arbitration in accordance with the applicable rules of the AAA or ICC (as applicable). The arbitrator will limit discovery as reasonably practicable to complete the arbitration as soon as practicable. The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding on both parties. The costs and expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by both parties. This Section 10.10 will not prohibit either party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. \
 \
10.11 Waiver. The waiver by either party of any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of this Agreement. \
 \
10.12 Severability. If any part of this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the grant of any rights to Customer under this Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the right granted will immediately terminate. \
 \
10.13 Interpretation. The headings appearing at the beginning of several sections contained in this Agreement have been inserted for identification and reference purposes only and must not be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. Whenever required by context, a singular number will include the plural, the plural number will include the singular, and the gender of any pronoun will include all genders. Whenever the words “include”, “includes” or “including” are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The word “or” is used in the inclusive sense of “and/or.” The terms “or,” “any” and “either” are not exclusive. \
 \
10.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the SensorLogic Terms of Purchase (if applicable) is the final and complete expression of the agreement between these parties regarding the SensorLogic Products. This Agreement supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement. No employee, agent, or other representative of SensorLogic has any authority to bind SensorLogic with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify, interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. If Customer acquired the SensorLogic Products from a SensorLogic reseller, then this Agreement is not exclusive of any rights Customer obtains under its agreement with the reseller; however, if there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the reseller agreement, then the provisions of this Agreement prevail, and if the reseller has granted Customer any rights that SensorLogic does not also directly grant to Customer in this Agreement, or that conflict with this Agreement, then Customer’s sole recourse with respect to such rights is against the reseller. \
 \
10.15 Updates to this Agreement. From time to time, SensorLogic may change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Agreement (each an “**Update**”), and reserves the right to do so in its sole discretion. If SensorLogic Updates this Agreement, it will make the Updated Agreement available, and the Updated Agreement will indicate the date of the latest revision. Customer is encouraged to review this Agreement periodically for changes. In the event that Updates to this Agreement materially alter Customer’s rights or obligations hereunder, SensorLogic will make reasonable efforts to notify Customer of the Updates. For example, SensorLogic may send a message to Customer’s email address that is currently associated with its SensorLogic account or generate a pop-up or similar notification when Customer accesses its SensorLogic account for the first time after such material changes are made. All Updated Agreements automatically take effect 30 days after they are posted, except that (i) disputes between Customer and SensorLogic will be governed by the version of this Agreement that was in effect on the date the dispute arose and (ii) unless specifically agreed otherwise, if Customer does not agree with any changes to this Agreement, Customer may terminate this Agreement as set forth above. Customer’s continued access to or use of the Services after an Updated Agreement has become effective indicates that Customer has read, understood and agreed to the current version of this Agreement.

Credits awarded pursuant to this SLA are the exclusive remedy for the  Service Levels falling below the performance standards set forth in this SLA.

b. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Credit Requests</span>. SensorLogic has no obligation to monitor the Covered Services, provide any Downtime reporting, or automatically issue any credits. If Customer believes a credit is due under this SLA, Customer can initiate a review by contacting SensorLogic at <span style="text-decoration:underline;">support@SensorLogic.com </span>(“**Credit Request**”).

Customer will provide SensorLogic with reasonable access to all  necessary personnel to answer questions regarding Downtime reported by Customer or Credit Requests  submitted by Customer. If SensorLogic cannot identify the cause of any Downtime reported by Customer,  Customer will provide additional information regarding the Downtime as SensorLogic may reasonably request  in order to assist SensorLogic with identifying the cause of the Downtime.

**SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE POLICY**

Support Policy Version 1.2

Updated September 1, 2021.

This Support and Maintenance Policy is associated with the SensorLogic Services (“Agreement”), applies to all Customers who purchase and pay for SensorLogic Services, and describes the support we provide for the paid Services. This Support Policy is incorporated by reference into the Agreement and all terms defined in the Agreement carry over here.

**Support Desk Services.** SensorLogic will provide technical and product support 9am to 5pm MTN, five days a week (Monday through Friday), by submitting a claim through the SensorLogic Support Desk. Definitions. “Error” means a failure of the Services to operate in material conformance with their documentation and specifications but does not include failures that result from a disaster that requires a disaster recovery response or environmental issues such as power loss, faulty networking or theft of hardware. “Fix” means a temporary software patch designed to mitigate the impact of an Error, notwithstanding that the Error still exists. “Plan" means a description of the steps being taken by SensorLogic to resolve the Error which includes: (i) a description of the skill sets of the SensorLogic staff that have been assigned to work on the Error, (ii) a high level description of the actions those staff are taking as part of the effort to resolve the Error, and; (iii) a preliminary technical plan for how the Error will be resolved. “Upgrade” means upgrades, improvements or changes to the Services designed to enhance operating performance without changing the basic functions of the Services and as made generally available by SensorLogic at no additional charge to its licensees of the Services. “Workaround” means a feasible change in operating procedures whereby an end-user can avoid the deleterious effects of an Error without material inconvenience. Problem Response and Escalation.

Support requests submitted to the Support Desk shall be responded to within the timeframes set forth in the table below, at which time, in each instance, a call tracking/ticket number shall be assigned. Each reported Error shall be assigned one of four severity classifications by SensorLogic based on the Error descriptions below: Critical, High, Medium or Low. This classification determines the response time promised in remedying the Error, as described below: Error Classification Description Response Times Critical Error that results in the loss of all capability of the Services and for which there is no suitable then existing Workaround. Initial Response: within two business hours of case being submitted Ongoing communication: Once every hour Resolution/Workaround: Respond to Customer with a Workaround or Plan for resolving the Error within 48 hours of the initial response. SensorLogic shall assign all necessary resources on a priority basis to resolve the Error and ensure that those resources work continuously on the Error until an actual resolution is provided. High Error that disables major fundamental functions from being performed and therefore affects the normal operations of the Services AND for which there is no suitable then-existing Workaround. Initial Response: within four business hours of case being submitted Ongoing Communication: Once every six hours Resolution/Workaround: Respond to Customer with a Workaround or Plan for resolving the issue within 48 hours of initial response. Medium Error that disables only certain non-essential functions but that does not affect the normal operation of the Services. Initial Response: within six business hours of case being submitted Ongoing Communication: Once every week Resolution/Workaround: Respond to Customer with a Workaround or Plan for resolving the Error within 5 business days of initial response; however, the actual Fix for the Error may be included in the next regularly scheduled Upgrade or such other scheduled Upgrade as timing and planning permits. Low Intermittent Errors that do not materially affect normal operation of the Services. Initial Response: within one business day of case being submitted Ongoing Communication: Once every two weeks Resolution/Workaround: Respond to Customer with a Workaround or Plan for resolving the Error within 10 business days of initial response; however, the actual Fix for the Error may be included in the next regularly scheduled Upgrade or such other scheduled Upgrade as timing and planning permits. SensorLogic’s Workaround and resolution time commitments above are contingent on Customer meeting its assistance obligations set forth below. Customer Obligations. (a) Technical Contacts. Customer will be responsible for (a) obtaining, maintaining, installing and configuring SensorLogic Hardware and Customer and third party software meeting requirements provided by SensorLogic for proper use and access to the Services, (b) validating critical failures by testing that they are reproducible and providing SensorLogic with all necessary documentation (such as screen shots and database query outputs), and (c) providing SensorLogic with remote access to Customer’s physical computers or virtual machines/workloads in the cloud, as needed, for providing Support Services. (b) Reasonable Assistance and Access. Customer must provide SensorLogic with reasonable access to all necessary personnel and information and promptly answer all questions regarding Errors and other problems reported to SensorLogic, and SensorLogic will have the right to access the Services for purposes of implementing Fixes and Upgrades and supporting the Services. (c) Compliance with the Agreement. Customer will be responsible for complying with the terms of this Agreement. SensorLogic reserves the right, in addition to other remedies available, to suspend provision of the Support Services for so long as Customer is in violation of the Agreement.
